# RBTrees
Implementation of red-black trees in Haskell, using the type checker to check the balancedness assumption.

This was done as a learning experience and is not designed and tested - check out the [reference implementation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/llrbtree-0.1.1/docs/Data-Set-RBTree.html).
